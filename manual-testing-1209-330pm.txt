# Main program page
- "Set Active" button for an inactive program doesn't do anything

# Program Overview
- Skipping seems to work OK
- Workout completion shows up ok as well
- The week with unmodified workouts should show up first. For instance, week 1 has all workouts as skipped or complete. Week 2 has uncompleted workouts, so that should show up immediately when I select/open the active program.

# Workout Overview
- Supersets should have more than just a letter to indicate that they are grouped. It should say something like superset or soemthing

# Workout Logging Modal
- We don't need to show suggested weights for an exercise. I'd prefer to show the prescribed rep range and either RIR or RPE
- Feature Idea: Make the reps and weight starting point to be the last recorded set's values to make modification quicker
- Feature Request: I should see the last workout's performance for a given exercise. Also, I'd like to have a button where I can see previous performance of a workout across time. This is a more major update! However, the most important thing would be to show me the last workout's performance metrics so I know what to build on.
- Bug? I'm able to mark a workout as complete even if I have just 1 set completed. -- Actually this might be ok! It's frustrating in other apps that I can't record a partial workout.	

# Claude's Review and Ideas
 Issues Found

  1. "Set Active" button doesn't work

  - Severity: High (blocks basic functionality)
  - Location: Main program page
  - Action: Need to investigate and fix

  2. Week navigation UX issue

  - Current: Shows week 1 by default
  - Desired: Show first week with uncompleted workouts
  - Rationale: More logical - user wants to see where they left off
  - Complexity: Medium (requires logic to find first incomplete week)

  3. Superset labeling unclear

  - Current: Just shows a letter (A, B, C)
  - Desired: Label like "Superset A" or similar
  - Complexity: Low (UI text change)

  4. Workout logging modal improvements

  - Remove: Suggested weights display
  - Add: Prescribed rep range + RIR/RPE
  - Feature: Pre-populate with last recorded set's values
  - Feature: Show last workout's performance for this exercise
  - Feature: Historical performance view button
  - Complexity: Medium to High (requires new queries, UI design)


More Notes on Rep Range input from CSV
Change PrescribedSet schema to store rep ranges as strings:

  model PrescribedSet {
    id         String   @id @default(cuid())
    setNumber  Int
    reps       String   // "8-12" or "5" (stored as string to support ranges)
    weight     String?  // Optional, e.g., "135lbs" or "65%" or null
    weightUnit String?  // "lbs", "kg", "%" or null
    rir        Int?
    rpe        Float?
    notes      String?

    exerciseId String
    exercise   Exercise @relation(fields: [exerciseId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  }

  In the workout logging modal, we'd display:
  Set 1: 8-12 reps @ RIR 2
  Set 2: 8-12 reps @ RIR 2

  Does this match your vision? If so, I'll need to:
  1. Update the schema (migration)
  2. Update CSV import to handle rep ranges
  3. Update logging modal to display rep ranges instead of suggested weights
